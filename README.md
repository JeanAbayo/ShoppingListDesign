ShoppingList
======================

ShoppingList makes shopping quick, easy and fun allowing users to add, update, view or delete items in a shopping list and share the lists with the public.

This is a basic html template, I will be using for my ShoppingList app

### Prerequisites

I am using basic CSS, bootstrap and jQuery for the template
### Installing

To get up and running clone the repo and open the '.html' files in the browser

```
git clone https://github.com/JeanAbayo/ShoppingListDesign.git

```
